1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
The minimum RTO for a single AZ outage is typically 1-2 minutes. Because we run a multi-az database so when single AZ outage, 
Amazon RDS will automatically failover to the standby replica. This failover process typically takes 60-120 seconds.


2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
For a single region outage, we must do 2 things:
- promote readreplica to primary database
- Setup application to use new primary database
So, I think that it costs about 20 minutes.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
- It seems like tens of seconds. AWS RDS will replicate almost immediately to standby database.

4.Minimum RPO for a single region outage
- It seems like tens of seconds. AWS RDS will replicate almost immediately to readreplica database.
